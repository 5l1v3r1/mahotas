title: Have a single _mahotas module
desc: |-
  Have a single _mahotas module instead of a bunch of small files.
  
  This should make loading faster if you use more than one function (without any
  real cost to those that don't, I believe).
  
  Probably just a matter of fiddling with setup.py too.
