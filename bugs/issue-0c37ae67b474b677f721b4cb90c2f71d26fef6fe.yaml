title: Try common-case-fast-exceptions-later optimisation for dilate/erode
desc: |-
  Most of the complexity in dilate()/erode() is in handling the boundaries.
  
  Perhaps a good optimisation would be:
  
  for pixel not near borders:
      really fast loop with no ifs
  
  for borders:
     complicated loop with a bunch of weird corner cases.
