==================
INSTALLING MAHOTAS
==================

From binary packages
--------------------

There are a few binary packages.

For **Windows**: Christoph Gohlke maintains binary packages at
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

For FreeBSD, there are ports packages at
http://www.freshports.org/graphics/mahotas/ Unfortunately, they may be slightly
out of date.

Using pip/easy_install
----------------------

Mahotas should install just fine with pip or easy_install. Either one of the
following should work::

    pip install mahotas
    easy_install mahotas

You will need to have numpy installed as well as a C++ compiler.

From source
-----------

You can use the simple::

    python setup.py install


You need the numpy headers and a C++ compiler.

Dependencies
------------

numpy

If you are running tests, ``scipy`` is sometimes used (as a comparison). It is
otherwise not used in mahotas (since version 0.7).
